## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**, with graduation planned for 2026.  
Alongside school, I work full-time in **telecommunications**, specializing in business fiber/HFC installs, modem diagnostics, signal troubleshooting, Viavi meter use, and customer-facing technical support.

I'm transitioning into software engineering because I enjoy solving problems, building systems, and constantly learning new technologies. My long-term goal is to work in **software development, cloud, or AI-driven engineering**.

I’m also balancing school, work, and family life — and still pushing forward every day.
